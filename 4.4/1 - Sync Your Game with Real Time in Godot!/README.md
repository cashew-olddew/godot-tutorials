# Sync Your Game With Real Time In Godot!

This project corresponds to [Sync Your Game With Real Time In Godot!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGueZ4h22Z8)

## Topics covered

- [Godot Time](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_time.html)

## Notes

In this video we are taking a look at getting real dates and time in Godot. Additionally we demistify the godot documentation with a neat way of quickly finding out which function to call whenever trying to use real time in a game.

On top of doing something similar to a day-night cycle, we also take a look at how we'd show things depending on the season outside. For example, during autumn, we'd show a pumpkin.
