# Pathfinding grids with AStarGrid2D

This project corresponds to [The Last Tutorial You'll Need for Coroutines in Godot 3.5 and 4.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaVRT_YbmWY)

## Topics covered

- (Common) [Coroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine)
- (Godot 4.2) [Await](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#awaiting-for-signals-or-coroutines)
- (Godot 3.5) [Yield](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#coroutines-with-yield)

## Notes

There was quite a large leap between how coroutines are handled in Godot 3.5 and Godot 4.2. Instead of Yield, which was used in Godot 3.5, the new Await keyword is being used in Godot 4.2. The video aims to cover how to use coroutines and the differences between the two versions.
