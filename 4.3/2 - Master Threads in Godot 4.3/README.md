# The Ultimate Godot 4.3 Export, Demo and DLC Guide

This project corresponds to [Master THREADS in Godot 4.3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox5jp_ySFlg)

## Topics covered

- [Using multiple threads in Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/performance/using_multiple_threads.html)
- [Loading a texture with a separate thread](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/blob/3.0-d69cc10/misc/threads/thread.gd)
## Notes

In this video I am showcasing the utility of multi threading in Godot 4.3. Threads are extremely useful for when we want to pass methods which are expensive computationally to different other cores of your processor. This leads to having a much smoother experience, helping reduce frame drops and speed up loading times.

On top of that, this video also tackles issues that might occur when working with threads like: race conditions, deadlocks and thread synchronization through rendezvous and barriers applied on both mutexes and semaphores.
