# Godot MATCH

This project corresponds to [I Had No Idea Godot's MATCH Was So Powerful!](https://youtu.be/cdPfpPEn6D8)

## Topics covered

- [Match](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#match)

## Notes

Recently I had to use Godot's Match feature and I was absolutely amazed by its capabilities. While other programming languages all have their flavors of a match or switch statement, I haven't seen any so versatile and powerful as the one in gdscript.

There are many possible applications for the Match statement. One could make a script which checks if a player has performed a combo, a script for figuring out cooking recipes or even for applying Logic Programming concepts, similar to those you'd find in a language like Prolog.
