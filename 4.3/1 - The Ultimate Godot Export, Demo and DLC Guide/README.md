## Notes

In this video I am trying to solve all questions that one might have when trying to export a game in Godot 4.3. As a start, I am covering the most basic way of exporting on Windows, Linux, Android, Web and Mac and afterwards I take a look over setting up a Demo and a DLC for your game. Finally, we take an in depth look at all the options for each environment.

You might wonder: Why the weird order? I wanted to include the most basic and interesting things first, and then, go over the options in depth for whoever is interested.
Please let me know if you have any question or issues, as I'm trying my best to answer all comments.
