## Notes

In this video I made a little game about decorating a Christmas tree. The main feature covered is dragging decorations and dropping them onto the tree, but on top of that, we discuss best practices to follow in order to achieve a scalable and maintainable codebase. The dragging and dropping variants covered are: Simple dragging and dropping, snapping to a point when dragging and dropping and snapping to predefined areas while dragging and dropping.
