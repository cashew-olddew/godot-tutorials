# All About Cursors in Godot 4.3

This project corresponds to [All About CURSORS in Godot 4.3](https://youtu.be/AEYWaXcgzcc)

## Topics covered

- [Cursor Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/inputs/custom_mouse_cursor.html)
- [How to reduce software cursor input lag](https://forum.godotengine.org/t/mouse-trail-has-1-frame-delay-is-there-anything-i-can-do/38852)
- [Shaders](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/shaders/introduction_to_shaders.html)

## Notes

In this project we are looking at how to setup a basic cursor, at how to change which cursor an UI element will show, how to handle cursor changes on more complex elements and how create a Software Cursor that will follow the mouse and interact with the world. For example, such a cursor could go behind certain elements in the foreground or even have shaders applied to it.
