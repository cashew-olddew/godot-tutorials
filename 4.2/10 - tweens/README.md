## Notes

This video aims to cover in-depth Godot tweeners and how to use Tweens. Tweens are most helpful for creating animation and can really bring life to a game.
With tweens, one can do simple sequential animations or make complex parallel animations. This video also teaches easing and transitions, which give a more natural movement to game characters.
