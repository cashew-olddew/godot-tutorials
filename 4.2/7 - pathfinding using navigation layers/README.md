# Pathfinding Using Navigation Layers

This project corresponds to [Master Tilemap PATHFINDING & Obstacle Avoidance in Godot 4.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT22SXYpoYM)

## Topics covered

- [Introduction to 2D Navigation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/navigation/navigation_introduction_2d.htmll)
- [Navigation Agents](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.0/tutorials/navigation/navigation_using_navigationagents.html#doc-navigation-using-navigationagents)
- [Godot Groups](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/groups.html)
- [Update Tiles at runtime](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_tilemap.html#class-tilemap-private-method-tile-data-runtime-update)

## Notes

- This is yet another video on pathfinding. This time we combine the best features in Godot: Pathfinding, Tilemaps and Navigation Layers. This tutorial aims to cover the usage and quirks of them, presenting how basic pathfinding is done, how to apply avoidance and finally, how to use obstacles on a Tilemap with different approaches, such as physics layers and updating navigation layers at runtime.
