## Notes

- Localization is a very important aspect of game development, especially if you want to reach a wider audience. While it is sometimes overlooked, localization is a simple process which can boost your game's popularity, and most importantly, make it more accessible to people around the world, giving them the opportunity to enjoy your game in their native language.
