# Need better code? Use Signals in Godot!

This project corresponds to [Need better code? Use Signals in Godot!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQl0HC-2FNk)

## Topics covered

- [Godot Signals](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.html)
- [Area2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_area2d.html)

## Notes

Signals are one of the most useful and easiest to use feature Godot has to offer. They provide a way to easily handle communication between two nodes. Signals are basically the Godot implementation of the observer design pattern.

This video aims to cover how to attach a signal to a node from inside the editor, how to connect a signal through code and even how to declare your own signals.
