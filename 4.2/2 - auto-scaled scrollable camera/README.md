This project corresponds to [Automatically zoom camera to a Tilemap in Godot 4.2](https://youtu.be/sSojoDM-0Ps)

## Topics covered

- [Camera2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_camera2d.html), [Camera Limits](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_camera2d.html#class-camera2d-method-set-limit), [Camera Zoom](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_camera2d.html#class-camera2d-property-zoom),[Tilemaps](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_tilemap.html)

## Notes

- While a lerp function following an inverse exponential could be beneficial, it only adds to the complexity of the tutorial. If, however, you want to learn more about it, check [this great blogpost](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/improved-lerp-smoothing-) by Scott Lembcke
