## Topics covered

## Notes

This video aims to showcase the most commonly used character animation techniques. Depending on your use case and on your assets, you will learn how to animate your characters with individual sprites or complete sprite sheets. Additionally, sometimes your context won't allow for AnimatedSprite2D nodes. For such cases, you can use the AnimationPlayer node to easily create animations.
