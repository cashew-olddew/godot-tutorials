# Add Undo and Redo to Your Game

This project corresponds to [How to Correctly Pause ANYTHING in Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXzPMss-vUk)

## Topics covered

- [Process Modes](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/pausing_games.html)
- [Shaders](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/shaders/introduction_to_shaders.html)

## Notes

Pausing a game might seem like a trivial thing to do in Godot. However, there are a few things that have to be taken into consideration when implementing this feature.

This video aims to teach how pausing works, what process modes are and how to pause animated shaders in Godot 4.2. It also covers how shaders are separately paused through different means, other than process modes.

The project is not 100% the same as the one in the video because that one was using a texture which wasn't CC0. I changed it to a new bubble texture.
