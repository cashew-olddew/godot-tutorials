# Steering and visualizing forces

This project corresponds to [Steering and visualizing forces in Godot 4.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUa1WxSXprI)

## Topics covered

- [Steering](https://natureofcode.com/autonomous-agents/)
- [Drawing shapes in Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/2d/custom_drawing_in_2d.html)

## Notes

- While steering is already a very interesting topic, we are just dipping our toes into autonomous agents and natural behaviors. I recommend the wonderfully written [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com) if you want to learn more.
