# Godot Tutorials

## What is this?

While tutorial videos are be useful for learning, they're not very useful when you want to quickly try out the project yourself or when you want to copy some of the code from the tutorial. This repository aims to provide the godot projects presented in all godot-related tutorials on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@cashewolddew)

## Structure

You will usually be able to find the specific projects directly from the video descriptions, but if you want to navigate through the repository, each tutorial has its own folder, is named after the video title and is placed under a directory named after the godot version used in the tutorial

## Assets and credits

If you want to use the assets from these tutorials, you can find them in the README.md files present under each tutorial project directory

## Contributions

If you find any:
- broken links
- bugs in the listed projects,
- mismatches between the content here and in the attached videos
- imporvement ideas
